<b style="color: blue;">Adi Shankara</b> <p>also called <mark>Adi Shankaracharya (Sanskrit: आदि शङ्कर, आदि शङ्कराचार्य, romanized: Ādi Śaṅkara, Ādi Śaṅkarācārya, lit</mark>. <p style="color:olivedrab;">First Shankaracharya',[note 2] pronounced [aːdɪ ɕɐŋkɐraːt͡ɕaːrjɐ]),[note 3] was an Indian Vedic scholar and teacher (acharya).[1] His works present a harmonizing <u>reading of the sastras, </u>with liberating knowledge of the self at its core, synthesizing the Advaita Vedanta teachings of his time.[2][web 1]

<em style="color: blueviolets;">Due to his later fame, over 300 texts are attributed to him, including </em>commentaries (Bhāṣya), introductory topical expositions (Prakaraṇa grantha) and poetry (Stotra).[3][4] However, most of these are likely to be written by admirers or pretenders or scholars with an eponymous name.[5][6] Works known to be written by Shankara himself are the Brahmasutrabhasya,[3] his commentaries on ten principal Upanishads,[3][5] his commentary on the Bhagavad Gita,[7] and the Upadeśasāhasrī.[8][9] The authenticity of Shankara being the author of <u>Vivekacūḍāmaṇi has been questioned and mostly rejected</u> by scholarship.[10][11]

<del>The central concern of Shankara's writings is the liberating knowledge of the</del> true identity of jivatman (individual self) as Ātman-Brahman,[9][12] taking the Upanishads as an independent means of knowledge, beyond the ritually-oriented Mīmāṃsā-exegesis of the Vedas.[13][14][note 4][note 5] Shankara's Advaita shows influences from Mahayana Buddhism, despite Shankara's critiques;[15][16] and Hindu Vaishnava opponents have even accused Shankara of being a "crypto-Buddhist,"[17][18][19][note 6] a qualification</p>

<b>The legend</b> of Chanakya and Chandragupta is detailed in the Pali-language Buddhist chronicles of Sri Lanka. It is not mentioned in Dipavamsa, the oldest of these chronicles.[11] <u>The earliest Buddhist source to mention the legend is </u>Mahavamsa, which is generally dated between fifth and sixth centuries CE. <b>Vamsatthappakasini</b> (also known as Mahvamsa Tika), <mark>a commentary on Mahavamsa, provides some more details about the legend. Its author is unknown, and it is </mark>dated variously from sixth century CE to 13th century CE.[12] Some other texts provide additional details about the legend; for example, the <del>Maha-Bodhi-Vamsa and the Atthakatha give the names of the nine Nanda kings said to have preceded Chandragupta.[11][13]
</del>Jain version
<small>The Chandragupta-Chanakya legend is mentioned in several commentaries of the Shvetambara canon. The most well-known version of the Jain legend is contained in the Sthaviravali-Charita or Parishishta-Parvan, written by the 12th-century writer Hemachandra.[1] Hemachandra's account is based on the Prakrit kathanaka literature (legends and anecdotes) composed between the late first century CE and mid-8th century CE. These legends are contained in the commentaries (churnis
